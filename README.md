# udemy_angular

Taking an angular course on Udemy.  It is unlikely anyone is going to grab this project and use it (it is just learning code after all), but if you do, you will want to delete the "." folders.  I have them there because I am using github to transfer between work and home for this and I am using different IDEs.
